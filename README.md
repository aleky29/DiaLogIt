DiaLogIt is a personal project for satisfying a specific personal need: to write down glucose levels.
I decided that this app should write the values into a Google Sheet since ,from there, I can easily then download it to train AIs (Random Forest, SVM...) to then study my glucose's statistics and make decisions for my personal health and well being.

PLEASE NOTE:
This project was mostly made looking into the article:

It is recommended to follow it, as the code in this repository should just be taken as a further, deeper example of a very similar use case.
